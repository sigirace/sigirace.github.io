### 1.1 Autoencoder

```
An autoencoder,  autoassiciator, or Diabolo network is an artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality  reduction. Recently, the autoencoder concept has become more widely used for learning generative models of data.

autoencoder의 중요한 task는 **Dimensionality reduction**이며 최근에는 Generative model learning으로도 사용하고 있다. 

### 1.3 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction(NLDR)

```
Nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also known as manifold learning, refers to various related techniques that aim to project high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional latent manifolds, with the goal of either visualizing the data in the low-dimensional space, or learning the mapping (either from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional embedding or vice versa) itself.[1][2] The techniques described below can be understood as generalizations of linear decomposition methods used for dimensionality reduction, such as singular value decomposition and principal component analysis.
