Abstractâ€”Neural networks have become a powerful tool in
pattern recognition and part of their success is due to generalization from using large datasets. However, unlike other
domains, time series classification datasets are often small. In
order to address this problem, we propose a novel time series
data augmentation called guided warping. While many data
augmentation methods are based on random transformations,
guided warping exploits the element alignment properties of
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and shapeDTW, a high-level
DTW method based on shape descriptors, to deterministically
warp sample patterns. In this way, the time series are mixed
by warping the features of a sample pattern to match the
time steps of a reference pattern. Furthermore, we introduce
a discriminative teacher in order to serve as a directed reference
for the guided warping. We evaluate the method on all 85 datasets
in the 2015 UCR Time Series Archive with a deep convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN).
