Data augmentation for images is a well-explored field,
especially in combination with neural networks. It has almost become a standard practice for image classification.
For example, many of the popular Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) based architectures used a form of data
augmentation in their training, such as the original proposals of
AlexNet [11], Very Deep Convolutional Networks (VGG) [13],
and Residual Networks (ResNet) [14]. Comparatively, there
are fewer established time series data augmentation methods
and fewer standard data augmentation practices in time series
classification [15]. Most of the methods that exist are just
time series adaptations inspired by image recognition. These
methods generally rely on simple transformations, such as
jittering (adding noise), scaling, rotation, etc.
